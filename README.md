# ReinforcementLearning

Research topics include:

- actor-critic
- adaptive methods that work with fewer (or no) parameters under a large number of conditions
- bug detection in software projects[25]
- continuous learning
- combinations with logic-based frameworks[26]
- exploration in large MDPs
- human feedback[27]
- interaction between implicit and explicit learning in skill acquisition
- intrinsic motivation which differentiates information-seeking, curiosity-type behaviours from task-dependent goal-directed behaviours large-scale empirical evaluations
- large (or continuous) action spaces
- modular and hierarchical reinforcement learning[28]
- multiagent/distributed reinforcement learning is a topic of interest. Applications are expanding.[29]
- occupant-centric control
- optimization of computing resources[30][31][32]
- partial information (e.g., using predictive state representation)
- reward function based on maximising novel information[33][34][35]
- sample-based planning (e.g., based on Monte Carlo tree search).
- securities trading[36]
- transfer learning[37]
- TD learning modeling dopamine-based learning in the brain. Dopaminergic projections from the substantia nigra to the basal ganglia function are the prediction error.
- value-function and policy search methods
